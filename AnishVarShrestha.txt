Hi GCA team. I'm Anish Var Shrestha from Baghdol, Lalitpur. 
I'm a final year student of BSc.CSIT in Nagarjuna College of IT, and I'm currently learning AI advance and AI Pro extra course also.
Sharing about this 3 days session was really amazing. Although I have been using Gitlab from long time
I didn't have knowledge about branching and all. Thank You Milan Dai and GCA. Learning from professional
is always fruitfull and it has been fruitfull to me.
Thank You!
